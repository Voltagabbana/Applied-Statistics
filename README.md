# "Mobility data analysis in Greater Maputo Area – Mozambique"

Material of the project "Mobility data analysis in Greater Maputo Area – Mozambique" carried by Gabriele Moro, Luca Meda, Jonas Gustafson for the master course of Applied Statistics in Politecnico di Milano, Mathematical Engineering.

## Introduction

Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a common tool used in
mobility settings to track, with GPS data, movements of
citizens in a particular environment. Our dataset contains, in
the form of OD data, information on flows of 9786 people in
the 329 morphological districts, in which the city of Maputo
has been divided, collected from July to October 2019. The
results we can extract from these data can be useful for
policy makers to have a better understanding of urban
mobility and address issues with specific policies.
